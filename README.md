# GMM-GMR for robot learning

This project implements a Gaussian Mixture Regression (GMM-GMR) to learn an inverse kinematics model of a robot based on a given dataset. Prediction results from the model learnt using GMM-GMR will be compared with resutls from the formulated model based on differential drive robot kinematics. Details of the model and dataset formulation are given in [this pdf (formulation)](documents/formulation.pdf). Details of the algorithm and implementation choices are given in [this pdf (gmmgmr)](documents/gmmgmr.pdf)


## Running the code
To run the code, do 

```
python3 run.py
```

from within the `src` directory

The learning datasets are included in the `src/datasets/` directory as `learning_dataset_0_ordered.csv` and `learning_dataset_0_bigger.csv`

A summary of items in `src` :

* `bic_from_sklearn/` - directory containing csv files with BIC values calculated using `sklearn.mixture.GaussianMixture` for tuning K
* `datasets/` - directory containing different variations of the learning dataset, some have been simply pre-processed as detailed in the report
* `ds0/` - original robot dataset
* `figures/` - where figures generated by `run.py` are saved to
* `models/` - where trained models are stored as csv files. Each model has 2 associated csv files, one for means and one for covariances.
* `temp/` - directory that `train.py` outputs everything to
* `dataloader.py` - module for processing raw data from `ds0`, run this using `python3 dataloader.py` to generate the learning dataset as detailed in the report (already run and stored in `datasets/`)
* `gmmgmr.py` - module where GMM-GMR implementation is in
* `IKinModel.py` - inverse kinematics functions
* `run.py` - executable that outputs all plots used in the report
* `train.py` - run this to train models from scratch. Trained models are saved in `temp/`. Currently set up to only train on 500 samples so as to not take too long. Models saved in `models/` are trained on ~7600 samples and tested on ~1900 samples
* `utilities.py` - useful helper functions
